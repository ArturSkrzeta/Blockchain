In progress...

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chain of blocks that contain information.</li>
  <li>Each block contains data, hash and hash of previous block.
    <br>
    - data stored inside a block depends on type of blockchain <br>
    - hash, as a fingerprint, is unique and identifies a block with all of its content - it's being calculated once block created <br>
    - changing something inside the block causes the block's hash to change (that detects any atttempts of changes to block) <br>
    - hash of the previous block which creates a chain <br>
    - having blocks chained in that way, it ensures security of the blockchain <br>
    - changing one block would make all of the following blocks in the chain invalid because of invalid 'has of previous block'
  </li>
  <li>Additional security mechanizm is the proof-of-work:

  <li>Perfect for keeping track of changes over time.</li>
